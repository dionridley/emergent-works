        Justice-impacted Black and Brown youth and adults face systemic barriers that limit access to education, economic mobility, and meaningful career pathways. A single interaction with the criminal legal system can derail a lifetime of opportunity, while employers in tech and other growing fields continue to overlook resilient, capable talent.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body-sm lg:text-body text-text leading-relaxed">
        At Emergent Works, we address these inequities by centering the voices and potential of system-impacted individuals. Our work tackles the root causes &mdash; structural racism, limited access to digital skills and mentorship, and hiring practices that prioritize credentials over capability. We create pathways where participants can rebuild confidence, grow economically, and lead in their communities. Through this, we aim to shape a more equitable future where those most impacted by injustice can thrive and drive change.

          Our Story &amp;<br />Who We Are
        </h2>
        <p class="text-body-sm lg:text-body text-text leading-relaxed">
          Founded in 2020, Emergent Works was born from a bold question: what if technology could be a path to freedom? Originally launched as Code Cooperative, we began as a mentorship circle for justice-impacted individuals learning to code.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body-sm lg:text-body text-text leading-relaxed">
          Today, under the leadership of Army Armstead &mdash; a graduate of our first cohort who rose from mentee to mentor to Co-Founder and Executive Director &mdash; EW has grown into a movement that blends technology, creativity, and community to open doors for those most excluded from opportunity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body-sm lg:text-body text-text leading-relaxed">
          Our team is built from the communities we serve: 100% of staff are program alumni, 80% are system-impacted, 80% are BIPOC, and 40% are female-identifying. We prioritize representation and equity across our programs, leadership, and board, ensuring the voices of youth and system-impacted individuals shape our work every step of the way.
