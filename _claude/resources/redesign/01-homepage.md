There were moments where I doubted myself or felt like things were too hard, but being a part of this program showed me that persistence pays off. I learned that progress doesn't always happen overnight." -- **Dontay**
- "This program has truly impacted my life by giving me the confidence to grow, the skills to move forward, and the support of a community that encouraged me every step of the way." -- **Zeek**
- "When I came into EW, I was honestly lost. I had just turned 19, and I didn't know where I was really going. But I learned so much here, from Biggz, from Nas, from Tine, even from arguing with my peers. I learned how to control my emotions, how to communicate, how to present myself, how to really approach life differently." -- **Sheisty**

### Nashid Featured Testimonial
- "Emergent Works gave me the tools to successfully navigate the digital landscape of remote work, where success depends on communication, self-advocacy, and professional presence as much as the technical skills. The safe spaces that the team created to work through my own insecurities and anxieties, are things that can't be quantified."
- "Thank you Army & Emergent Works for truly caring about real solutions, just not the problems."
- -- **Nashid**

## Design / Layout Notes

1. **Overall page structure:** The page follows a vertical scrolling layout with alternating content sections. Sections alternate between light backgrounds (cream `#FFFAF0`) and darker backgrounds (dark green `#052812`).

2. **Header:** Sticky/fixed header with brand name on the left, horizontal navigation in the center, and a login button on the right.

3. **Hero section:** Full-bleed background image with large bold white text (83px Avenir, right-aligned) overlaid. The text "Rewriting Futures. One Skill At The Time." serves as the primary tagline.

4. **Mission + Image section:** Two-column layout. Left column has a circular image and "Discover More" button. The mission statement text spans below at 40px bold.

5. **Programs section:** Multi-row layout. Programs are listed in a grid/column format with bold titles (28px) and descriptions (19px). Horizontal line dividers separate some entries. The "Our Approach" heading appears large (72px) alongside a decorative image.

6. **Full-width photo break:** An atmospheric full-bleed photo section with no text, providing visual breathing room.

7. **Community Voices:** Three-column testimonial layout with circular portrait photos (273x273), quotes, and name attributions. A decorative image appears below the three columns.

8. **Nashid featured testimonial:** Two-column layout on a dark/colored background. Left column has an image, right column has two quotes in white text (24px) with an "Explore Our Impact" CTA button.

9. **Build With Us CTA:** Two-column layout. Left column has the heading (72px bold), descriptive text (25px bold), and three action buttons (Donate, Volunteer, Partner). The area below features three overlapping/stacked images creating a collage effect.

10. **Footer:** Two-column layout. Left column has navigation links (bold 25px), email, and physical address. Right column has the logo/seal image (285x285) and copyright notice. Social media icon bar sits above the columns.

11. **Color scheme:** The site uses a nature-inspired palette dominated by dark greens (`#052812`, `#24582A`, `#445E4D`), cream (`#FFFAF0`), and accent colors including peach (`#F9C5B4`), purple (`#D2ACF7`), and sage green (`#B1D3BB`).

12. **Wix component IDs** of major sections (for reference):
    - Header: `comp-m7yr4mmi`

## Visual Verification (Playwright, 2026-02-16)

This section documents corrections and additions discovered by visually browsing the actual rendered page via Playwright at 1400px viewport width. These observations supersede conflicting descriptions in the sections above.

### Corrections to Layout Descriptions

1. **Hero text alignment (Section 1)**: Documentation says "right-aligned" but the hero text "Rewriting Futures. One Skill At The Time." is actually CENTER-ALIGNED (or slightly left-center). The text sits in the lower portion of the hero image, white text on the photo.

2. **Decorative Brand Illustrations**: The page features THREE recurring brand illustrations in a gold-yellow + dark green cartoon style. These are PNG images but functionally act as decorative design elements:
   - **Laptop illustration**: Golden-yellow laptop/computer with dark green keyboard and border accents. Appears in the Mission/Approach section (left of "Discover More" button) and again overlapping the bottom of the group photo near the footer.
   - **Smartphone illustration**: Golden-yellow mobile phone with dark green heart icon on screen. Appears in the Mission/Approach section (right side, near "Our Approach" heading).
   - **Microphone illustration**: Golden-yellow microphone with dark green handle. Appears between the full-width photo section and the "Community Voices" heading.

   These illustrations are consistent brand elements used across ALL pages of the site (laptops, phones, hearts, tablets, microphones, etc.).

3. **Section 2+3 are visually one continuous section**: The documentation separates "Mission Statement" (Section 2) and "Programs/Our Approach" (Section 3), but visually they flow as one continuous cream-background section: Mission text -> illustrations + "Discover More" button -> "Our Approach" heading -> 2x2 program grid -> "Programs" button.

4. **Section 2 layout**: Doc says "Two-column strip - Left column: Circular image." The actual layout is: centered mission text at top, then below that the laptop illustration on the left, "Discover More" button in the center, phone illustration on the right, then "Our Approach" heading left-aligned below.

5. **Programs grid (Section 3)**: The 4 programs are arranged in a 2x2 grid layout:
   - Row 1: "Digital Literacy Training" (left) | "Social Emotional Learning" (right)
   - Row 2: "Career Development" (left) | "Community Engagement" (right)
   - Horizontal line dividers separate the rows
   - "Programs" button centered below

6. **Community Voices (Section 5)**: All three testimonial columns have the circular portrait photo at the TOP, then quote text below, then name attribution at the bottom. The photos are uniformly positioned (same vertical level across all three columns).

7. **Nashid photo (Section 6)**: The circular portrait photo has a PROMINENT GOLD/YELLOW RING BORDER around it. The photo shows a Black man with glasses smiling, with an ocean/water background.

8. **"Explore Our Impact" button (Section 6)**: This button is GOLD-OUTLINED (gold/yellow border and text) on the dark green background, NOT a standard dark green pill button. This is the accent button style.

9. **Build With Us (Section 7) - Photo collage**: The right side features a SCATTERED POLAROID-STYLE PHOTO COLLAGE with 4-5 photos arranged at angles, each with gold/yellow frame borders. This is NOT the three separately listed rectangular images described in the documentation.

10. **Full-width photo (Section 4)**: Shows young people in a creative/music studio space. The photo sits within a dark green section (dark green padding/border around the photo), not truly full-bleed edge-to-edge.

11. **Navigation overflow**: The header shows only 5 nav items before "More" dropdown: Home, About Us, Programs, Impact, More. "Our Team", "Partner With Us", and "Donate" are presumably in the "More" dropdown.

12. **Footer logo**: The Emergent Works seal/logo is clearly visible as a dark green circle with gold ring decorations and "EMERGENT WORKS" text below it.
