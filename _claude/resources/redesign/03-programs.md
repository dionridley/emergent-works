## Layout Patterns

### Program Card Pattern
- **Two-column layout** with photo on one side and text content on the other
- **Alternating photo placement:** Cards alternate between photo-left/text-right and text-left/photo-right
  - Section 3 (T.RAP Direct): Photo LEFT, Text RIGHT
  - Section 4 (Technical Mentorship): Text LEFT, Photo RIGHT
  - Section 6 (TECK Partner): Photo LEFT, Text RIGHT
  - Section 7 (T.RAP Partner): Text LEFT, Photo RIGHT

### Program Detail Pattern
Each program card contains a consistent set of metadata fields:
- **Heading** (program name, large serif)
- **Description** (body text paragraph)
- **Eligibility** (bold label + value)
- **Duration** (bold label + value)
- **Apply/Book By Date** (bold label + value, currently "Ongoing" for all)
- **CTA Button** ("Apply" for direct programs, "Book" for partner programs)

### Section Alternation
- Dark green full-width sections serve as dividers/headers between program card groups
- Cream/white sections contain the program cards
- Pattern: Dark Green (Hero) -> Dark Green (How It Works) -> Cream (T.RAP) -> Cream (Tech Mentorship) -> Dark Green (Partners Header) -> Cream (TECK) -> Cream (T.RAP Partner) -> Dark Green (Testimonial/CTA)

## Notes for Redesign

1. **Placeholder button links:** All "Apply," "Book," and "Explore Impact" buttons link to either the homepage or About Us page as placeholders. These need to be wired to actual application forms or booking flows.

2. **Duration typo on T.RAP Direct:** The duration reads "July 2025 - June 2025" which appears to be a typo (likely should be "July 2025 - June 2026"). Confirm with the team.

3. **Shared photo reuse:** The same "IMG_0806.jpg" library/computer photo is used for both the Technical Mentorship card (Section 4) and the T.RAP Partner card (Section 7). Consider sourcing a distinct photo for one of these.

4. **Social media links:** Footer social links still point to default Wix placeholder URLs, not actual Emergent Works accounts.

5. **Programs For Partners separation:** The page clearly divides programs into two groups -- direct enrollment programs (T.RAP, Technical Mentorship) and partner-only programs (TECK, T.RAP for Partners). The "Programs For Partners" dark green divider section (Section 5) acts as the boundary between these groups. This organizational structure should be preserved in the redesign.

6. **No longer listed programs:** The following programs from the old site/documentation are NOT present on this page:
   - 1:1 Technical Mentorship (20 weeks) -- replaced by "Technical Mentorship" (12 weeks, virtual)
   - Digital Literacy (separate program) -- no longer a standalone offering
   - Digital Design (Fall 2025) -- not present
   - LEAP Fellowship -- not present
   - Hawai'i Digital Literacy Portal -- not referenced

7. **New programs/sections not in old documentation:**
   - TECK (partner-only digital literacy program)
   - "Programs For Partners" organizational section
   - T.RAP Partner version (distinct from direct T.RAP)
   - Blueberry testimonial

8. **Decorative brand illustrations:** Three distinct gold/green cartoon-style illustrations are used as visual accents. These are an important part of the brand identity on this page and should be carried forward or recreated in the redesign.

9. **"More" overflow in nav:** On this page, the navigation collapses "Our Team," "Partner With Us," and "Donate" into a "More" dropdown, unlike other pages where all items are visible. This is likely a viewport/responsive behavior.

10. **Consistent metadata pattern:** All four program cards follow the same structured metadata pattern (Eligibility, Duration, Apply/Book By Date, CTA button). This consistent structure aids scannability and should be maintained.
