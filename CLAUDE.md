# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This project follows a structured approach to planning, documentation, and implementation.

```
_claude/
|-- docs/           # Technical documentation and architecture
|   `-- .gitkeep
|-- plans/          # Implementation plans
|   |-- draft/      # Plans being developed or refined
|   |   `-- .gitkeep
|   |-- in_progress/ # Plans currently being implemented
|   |   `-- .gitkeep
|   `-- completed/  # Finished and archived plans
|       `-- .gitkeep
|-- prd/            # Product Requirement Documents
|   `-- .gitkeep
|-- resources/      # Reference materials and external docs
|   `-- .gitkeep
`-- research/       # Structured research output
    `-- .gitkeep
```

**Note:** `.gitkeep` files ensure empty directories can be committed to git.

### Directory Purposes

**`_claude/docs/`**
Technical documentation, architecture decisions, API specifications, and development notes.

**`_claude/plans/`**
Implementation plans following a structured template. Plans move through stages:
- **draft/** - Plans being refined, NOT ready for implementation
- **in_progress/** - Plans currently being actively worked on
- **completed/** - Finished plans for historical reference

**`_claude/prd/`**
Product Requirement Documents defining features, user stories, and requirements.

**`_claude/resources/`**
User-provided reference materials, external documentation, design specifications.

**`_claude/research/`**
Structured research output with multiple markdown files per topic.

## Plan Management Workflow
<!-- section: plan-management-workflow v2 -->

### IMPORTANT: Plan Execution Rules

⚠️ **STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED** ⚠️

1. **NEVER execute or implement tasks from plans in the `draft/` folder**
   - Draft plans are for review and refinement only
   - If asked to work on a draft plan, inform the user that the plan must be moved to `in_progress` first

2. **Only work on plans in the `in_progress/` folder**
   - These are the only plans approved for active development
   - Always verify a plan is in the correct folder before starting work

3. **If a user asks you to work on a draft plan:**
   - Politely explain that draft plans cannot be executed
   - Offer to move the plan to `in_progress` if they approve
   - Wait for explicit confirmation before moving any plans

4. **Actions outside of existing plans require explicit permission**
   - If a request is NOT part of any existing plan, ASK THE USER before executing
   - Questions are for information gathering, NOT permission to act
   - Only proceed with implementation when the user explicitly says to do it

5. **Understanding user intent**
   - "Can you..." or "How would..." questions are requests for information, not action
   - "Please..." or "Go ahead and..." or "Implement..." are explicit action requests
   - When in doubt, clarify what the user wants before proceeding

### Plan Status Workflow

1. **Create Plan**: `/dr-plan [detailed context]` creates numbered plan in `draft/` (e.g., `001-plan-name.md`)
2. **Review**: Examine the plan to identify any improvements or missing details
3. **Refine** (optional but recommended): `/dr-plan @_claude/plans/draft/001-plan.md [refinement request]` to enhance with extended thinking
   - Can be repeated multiple times
   - Shows diff summary before applying
4. **Move to Active**: Move the plan file from `draft/` to `in_progress/` when ready to implement
5. **Implement**: Work through plan phases systematically
6. **Minor Adjustments** (as needed): `/dr-plan @_claude/plans/in_progress/001-plan.md [minor changes]` for small corrections
7. **Complete**: Move the plan file from `in_progress/` to `completed/` when finished

**Plan Numbering:**
Plans are automatically numbered sequentially (001, 002, 003, ..., 999, 1000, ...) to track chronological order. The number is determined by scanning **all three folders** (draft/, in_progress/, completed/) to find the highest existing number, then incrementing by 1. The number stays with the plan when moved between folders.

Example: If your completed/ folder has plans 001-045 and in_progress/ has 046-047, the next plan created will be 048, even if draft/ is empty.

## Available Commands
<!-- section: available-commands v1 -->

This project uses the **project-management** plugin (dr- prefix) which provides:

- `/dr-init` - Initialize or update project structure
- `/dr-research [detailed prompt]` - Conduct deep research with extended thinking (supports multi-line prompts)
- `/dr-prd [detailed feature description OR @prd-file [refinement]]` - Create or refine comprehensive PRD with extended thinking
- `/dr-plan [detailed context OR @plan-file [refinement]]` - Create or refine implementation plan with extended thinking (dual-mode)

**Dual-Mode Refinement:**
Both PRDs and plans can be refined using the same commands. Use `/dr-prd @_claude/prd/feature.md [changes]` to refine PRDs or `/dr-plan @_claude/plans/draft/plan.md [changes]` to refine plans. Both commands use extended thinking and show diff summaries. They automatically detect whether you're creating or refining based on the `@` file reference.

**IMPORTANT - Date Handling:**
When creating any document with dates or timestamps, ALWAYS check the system environment for the current date/time. NEVER use hardcoded or assumed dates.

## Project-Specific Commands

**Build:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Preview (production build locally):**
```bash
npm run preview
```

**Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Dev server runs at `localhost:4321`.

**IMPORTANT - Dev/Preview Server Rule:**
Do NOT start the dev server (`npm run dev`) or preview server (`npm run preview`) from Claude Code. Background server processes hold ports (4321, 4322, etc.) and are difficult to clean up reliably, leading to port conflicts. The developer will start the server themselves. If you need to test against a running server (e.g., with Playwright), ask the developer to start it first, or confirm it is already running before using it.

## Development Principles

1. **Incremental Progress**: Build features incrementally with working code at each step
2. **Documentation First**: Document plans and decisions before implementing major features
3. **Test Coverage**: Write tests alongside implementation
4. **Code Review**: Review changes before merging
5. **Clear Communication**: Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions

## Task Completion Protocol
<!-- section: task-completion-protocol v1 -->

When working on tasks from an implementation plan, follow this protocol **for each phase**:

1. **Work through one phase at a time** following the plan's phase order
2. **Complete all tasks in the phase** and verify each works (run tests, check behavior)
3. **Update the plan file immediately** after completing the phase:
   - Check the boxes (`[x]`) for all completed tasks in that phase
   - Check the boxes for completed test verification items
   - Update the "Actual Time" in Implementation Notes if time tracking is present
4. **Report to the user** with a summary of what was completed and what phase is next
5. **Proceed to the next phase** or wait for user direction

The plan file must always reflect the current state of implementation. Never leave completed tasks unchecked.

## About This Project

**Emergent Works** (`emergentworks.org`) — an early-stage website project. The codebase is freshly scaffolded and minimal; there is currently a single placeholder index page.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Astro 5 (SSG, file-based routing)
- **UI Library:** React 19 (via `@astrojs/react` integration)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, imported in `src/styles/global.css`)
- **Content:** MDX support via `@astrojs/mdx`
- **SEO:** `astro-seo` for meta tags, `@astrojs/sitemap` for sitemap generation
- **Performance:** `astro-compress` for HTML/CSS/JS minification
- **Typography:** `@fontsource/inter` (self-hosted Inter font)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode via `astro/tsconfigs/strict`)
- **Package manager:** npm

## Project Layout

```
public/              # Static assets (favicons, images)
src/
  pages/             # File-based routes (.astro, .mdx)
    index.astro      # Homepage (placeholder)
  styles/
    global.css       # Global styles (Tailwind import)
astro.config.mjs     # Astro config (React, Tailwind, Sitemap, MDX, Compress)
tsconfig.json        # TypeScript config (strict, React JSX)
```

## Key Architecture Notes

- **Astro Islands:** Use React components only for interactive UI. Static content should use `.astro` components for zero JS shipped to the client.
- **Tailwind v4:** Uses the Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`), not the PostCSS plugin. Config is CSS-first via `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/styles/global.css`. No `tailwind.config` file — use CSS `@theme` directives for customization.
- **Routing:** Pages live in `src/pages/`. Astro generates routes from filenames automatically.
- **Site URL:** Configured as `https://emergentworks.org` in `astro.config.mjs` (used by sitemap generation).
